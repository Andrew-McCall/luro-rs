# Luro - Discord Bot

Welcome to Luro, a discord bot written in rust by Nurah#5103.

This project has a few goals:

- A fully featured Discord bot that is not paywalled.
- A Discord bot that is modern, embracing slash commands, interactions and more with less focus on legacy 'prefix' commands.
- Reasonably simple to use, with a modest feature set.
- The ability to replace most Discord bots with one that can do it all.

## Disclaimer

This project is offered as is, with no warranty under the expectation that things will break and there will be sudden breaking changes. Once this project has got to a reasonable place, semantic versioning will be used. This project is also being used to learn git, so things may be done in strange and unexpected ways. If you have any suggestions, please do voice them!
