# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently NO versions are supported, as Luro is in very active development. Once a somewhat stable base has been built, semantic versioning will be used.
Currently, no known vulnerabilities exist.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.0   | :x:                |
